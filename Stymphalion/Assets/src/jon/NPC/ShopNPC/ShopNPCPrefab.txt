Overview:
The shop npc prefab is to enable the creation of many different shop npcs at runtime. 

Components:

-Transform
	Stores information about object position, scale, and rotation
-Sprite Renderer
	Needed to be able to see the object

-Box Collider 2D
	Allows for collision detection. Needed for TouchingInteractable()

-NPC Environment Script
	Script allowing for the player to interact with an NPC in the environment. Has the is_quest bool checked,
	meaning the TouchingInteractable() function within the NPC environment script will be bound to the
	ShopNPC class.

-Animator
	Handles sprite animation for the player between the walking and idle states.

-Audio Source
	Allows for audio to be played when the ShopNPC is interacted with
